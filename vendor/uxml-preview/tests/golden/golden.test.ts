 * Golden tests, in two halves that answer different questions.
 *
 *   Regression — did our own output change? Compares against snapshots in
 *   tests/golden/snapshots/. No Unity, no browser, runs on every commit.
 *
 *   Accuracy — do we match Unity? Compares against tests/golden/unity/, which
 *   only exists once someone runs tools/UxmlLayoutDump.cs. Missing ground truth
 *   is reported as unmeasured and skipped: a build cannot fail for lacking a
 *   file no machine can generate, and an unmeasured case must never read as a
 *   passing one.
 *
 * Geometry is compared, not pixels. Unity draws text with its own font asset
 * and the browser does not, so a pixel diff over a case set with any text in it
 * measures font choice more than layout.
