 * pass unnoticed. It is not evidence of agreement with Unity, and no number
 * from it may be quoted as accuracy — there is no Unity CSS to compare against,
 * because Unity does not produce CSS. The visual comparison against Unity is a
 * one-time eye check with committed screenshots (S1 plan §1, criterion 3).
 *
 * Geometry is deliberately excluded. Yoga's rectangles are compared against
 * Unity by tests/golden, and the Yoga-to-DOM step by border-offset.test.ts;
 * repeating them here would make this snapshot churn on layout changes and blur
