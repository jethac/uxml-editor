 * parsed does not. Adding `ScrollView` means editing this table and nothing in
 * src/model or src/parser.
 *
 * `resolveControl` never returns null, and that is the point. An unrecognised
 * tag is drawn as a plain box rather than dropped — losing a whole subtree to
 * one unknown control is a defect, not a scope limit (S1 plan §6). Returning a
